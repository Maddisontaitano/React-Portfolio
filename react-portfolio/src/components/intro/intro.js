      <h2>About Me!</h2>
        
        <p> Hello! My Name is Maddison Taitano and I am 19 years old. 
            I am looking forward to starting my career in web stack developemnt. <br />
            I am from up north in Connecticut but I moved to North Carolina about 6 years ago.
            I took to a writing forum in middle school, which needed coding if you wanted to add any styling or pictures,
            so that is where I was first introduced. I took a coding class in highschool which
             peeked my interest, and that started the journey!
        </p>
