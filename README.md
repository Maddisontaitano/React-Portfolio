# React-Portfolio

        This webpage consists of great infromation about me.
         It also shows how you can contact me in several 
         different ways. In addition, it navigates you to
         all of my work with just one click! There is a 
         navigation bar at the top for easier usage. I found the 
         boxes very challenging. Getting them all 
         aligned in the center and positioned in relation to 
         each other was a little more thought-provoking than I 
         had intended.
